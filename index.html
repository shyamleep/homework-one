    <!-- Horiseon's three marketing strategies -->
    <div class="content">

        <!-- Strategy One: Search Engine Optimization -->
        <section id="search-engine-optimization" class="marketing">
            <img src="develop/assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" alt="Brainstorm of Search Engine Optimization solutions" class="float-left"/>
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Strategy Two: Online Reputation Management -->
        <section id="online-reputation-management" class="marketing">
            <img src="develop/assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" alt="Chart showing increasing positive reputation" class="float-right" />
            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Strategy Three: Social Media Marketing -->
        <section id="social-media-marketing" class="marketing">
            <img src="develop/assets/images/social-media-marketing.jpg" alt="Group meeting discussing social media strategy" class="float-left"/>
            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

    <!-- Sidebar detailing benefits of using Horiseon -->
    <aside class="sidebar">

        <!-- Lead Generation -->
        <section class="benefit">
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="develop/assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="Turning gear filters information into business leads"/>
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly
                to your website.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Brand Awareness -->

            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="develop/assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="Lightbulb signifying a new idea"/>
            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility
                for your business.
            </p>

        <!-- Cost Management -->

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer
                need to advertise your page.
